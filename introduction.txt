Brief Introduction About Myself

My name is Dennis Mukirai, and I am a student with a growing interest in technology, problem-solving, and software development. I enjoy learning how computers work and how technology can be used to create practical solutions to real-world problems.

Through my studies, I am developing skills in computing concepts, programming fundamentals, and collaborative tools such as GitHub. I am motivated to continue improving my technical abilities and applying them to both academic and personal projects.
